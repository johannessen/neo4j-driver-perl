# ABSTRACT: Information on planned improvements to Neo4j::Driver

=encoding utf8

=head1 TODO

See also: L<https://github.com/johannessen/neo4j-driver-perl/issues>

=head2 Functionality and API

=head3 Tier 0

=over

=item * Check Neo4p for deprecated / internal stuff, offer PR if necessary or
maybe fix directly.

=back

=head3 Tier 1

=over

=item * Drop Bolt deep_bless. This requires perlbolt Types v2 support though.
(I I<really> want this.)

=item * Refactor Node etc. to match the Jolt data structures instead of JSON;
refactor Record to be implemented as just a single array representing the row,
with the (C<get("2")>-fixed) column lookup hash appended at the array's end

=item * Remove defensive copies in C<property()>; document that C<properties()>
will then actually be the fastest way to get a single property (about 8% faster
than C<get()>).

=back

=head3 Tier 2

=over

=item * Neo4j::Driver::Net::HTTP::Tiny

=item * Refactor summary access

=item * add missing fields to result summary and counters, see
L</"Neo4j::Driver::ResultSummary"> / L</"Neo4j::Driver::SummaryCounters"> below

=item * Remove old-style Jolt (limit Jolt to 4.3+)

=back

=head3 Tier 3

=over

=item * Config rework, see L</"Neo4j::Driver::Config"> below

=item * look into why empty queries behave so weirdly (see test in F<summary.t>)

=item * we can probably get rid of the C<return_stats> internal API by using
the sim to modify the adapter directly (tests that need stats would have to
S<e. g.> set a global in the sim though)

=back

=head2 Tests, code quality, documentation

=over

=item * Improve test coverage:

=over

=item * Many yet uncovered code paths are obviously fine, but difficult or
impossible to cover. In some of these cases, it may be possible to refactor the
code, such as by banking on autovivification (i.e. don't defend against undefined
C<$a> in expressions like C<< $a->{b} >>; see L<perlref/"Using References">).
L<Test::Without::Module> might help in some cases.

=item * The C<deep_bless> subs contain a lot of assertions and other checks
that are not normally necessary. Since this logic seems to work fine, it should
be simplified. (This may also make it easier to unroll the recursion later.)

=item * Documenting each attribute in L<Neo4j::Driver::SummaryCounters> as individual
methods might be a quick way to bring up the B<pod> coverage stats a bit.

=back

=item * Write new unit tests for all modules.
Tests should probably live in files with names that are a good match for module
names, so that it's easy to find test for a specific module (Simulator and live
tests should perhaps be in separate files and directories.) The article
L<Perl Testing in 2023|https://toby.ink/blog/2023/01/24/perl-testing-in-2023/>
has some insight into how L<Test2> can simplify unit tests.

=item * Optimise the simulator for C<$hash = 0>.
Use of C<<< << >>> causes statements to end with C<\n>, which the simulator
could filter out. 
The internals test "transaction: REST 404 error handling" should run a distinct
statement.

=item * Consider migrating the LWP tests away from L<Mock::Quick> to reduce
the dependency chain (L<Mock::MonkeyPatch> and L<Mock::Sub> look extremely
light-weight, alternatives might I<perhaps> be L<Test::MockObject::Extends>
or L<Test::LWP::UserAgent>; there is also L<Sub::Override> and L<Test2::Mock>).

=item * Verify that L<Neo4j::Driver::Type::Node/"get"> and
L<Neo4j::Driver::Type::Relationship/"get"> really do return undef
(as documented), even when called in list context.

=item * We need complete working code examples, such as that Neo4j movies app.
Some of the deprecated functionality could also be implemented as plug-ins
in a dist named S<e. g.> Neo4j::Driver::Net::HTTP::Extra. Such a plug-in might
be directly useful to some users, but most importantly, it would serve to
demonstrate some of the plug-in API's functionality and how that can be used.

=item * Possible docs improvement: add "since version 0.xx" to all methods,
referring to the point when the method itself was added.

=back

=head1 Other ideas for specific modules

=head2 L<Neo4j::Driver::Config>

=over

=item * Config rework:

=over

=item * The big plan is to have a config object that can be used anywhere
(driver/session/tx), with any settings not required in a context simply ignored.
A config object would be created on the fly if a hash ref is provided.
Each context will merge the given config with whatever has been supplied
to the higher-level context, providing a mechanism for custom default values.

=item * Add transaction configuration; see:
L<https://neo4j.com/docs/http-api/4.4/actions/transaction-configuration/>

=item * Probably add bookmark support (added to HTTP in Neo4j 5.6)

=item * Fix memory leak in Neo4j::Driver::Net::HTTP

=item * part of the config rework is also plugin access to the configuration
(likely through the first_session and parse_uri events, but possibly also a
more generic config event)

=item * C<< encrypted => 1 >> should perhaps override C<http:> for consistency
(but not the other way around, for security)

=item * C<"v2"> as value for cypher_params: the quoted form should probably be
the canonical one, to simplify output

=back

=item * C<neo4j> URI scheme support: Ideally, the driver's C<config> method
would continue to return C<'neo4j'> even after the session is created.

=item * A reliable C<connection_timeout> config option might be good.
Not exactly sure how to achieve that across Bolt, LWP etc. Googling yields
L<IO::Socket::Timeout> and C<SocketConnectTimeout>, but I haven't really
researched further.

=item * Jolt results: if C<concurrent_tx>, then enforce C<gather_results>;
maybe formally discourage C<concurrent_tx>

=back

=head2 Neo4j::Driver::Events

=over

=item * The default implementation of the "error" event currently tries to
more or less recreate the old error message strings. Looking forward, having
L<Neo4j::Error> overload stringification and just throwing an object exception
might be an interesting option. However, we likely would have to roll C<croak>
ourselves (see L<Carp/"BUGS">). See L<https://perldoc.perl.org/functions/die>
for the special meaning of C<\n>.

=back

=head2 L<Neo4j::Driver::Session>

=over

=back

=head2 L<Neo4j::Driver::Transaction>

=over

=item * Run statements lazily: Just like with the official drivers, statements
passed to C<run> should be gathered until their results are actually accessed.
Then, and only then, all statements gathered so far should be sent to the
server using a single request. Challenges of this approach include that
notifications are not associated with a single statement, so there must be an
option to disable this behaviour; indeed, disabled should probably be the
default when stats are requested. Additionally, there are some bugs with
multiple statements (see tests C<non-arrayref individual statement> and
C<include empty statement>). Since stats are now requested by default,
this item might mean investing time in developing an optimisation
feature that is almost never used. Since the server is often run on localhost
anyway where latency is very close to zero, this item should not have high
priority.

=back

=head2 L<Neo4j::Driver::Record>

=over

=item * Consider whether to implement methods to query the list of fields for
this record (C<keys>, C<has>, C<size>) and/or a mapping function for all fields
(C<map>/C<forEach>). Given that this data should easily be available through
the Result object, these seem slightly superfluous though.

=item * Implement C<graph>; see
L<https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j/blob/3.5/community/server/src/main/java/org/neo4j/server/rest/transactional/GraphExtractionWriter.java>,
L<https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j-python-driver/wiki/1.6-changelog#160a1>.
L<https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j-javascript-driver/issues/140#issuecomment-247203874>.

=item * Maybe add C<field()> as alias for C<get()>. But do we actually need it?
In practice, field name collisions are incredibly rare, so this would I<only>
be used to avoid the possibly confusing C<< $record->get->get('key') >>
pattern, which is better done using C<< $record->get->properties->{key} >>
anyway. The official drivers only offer C<get()>, and C<field()> might be too
similar to C<fields()> in the official Java driver, so it isn't even clear
if the name is acceptable.

=back

=head2 L<Neo4j::Driver::Result>

=over

=item * Improve documentation, esp. wrt. side-effects of e. g. C<has_next()>
(it's already improved over what it was, but the Result description could use
a mention of this too, perhaps in the context of the I<begin> of a stream's
period of being valid)

=item * C<size()> doesn't need to exhaust the result stream. It only needs to
detach it. The official drivers don't have C<size()>, so we're free to redefine
it in order to make it more useful to Perl users.
It would be enough to detach the stream, buffering all records.
The only reason we even have C<size()> is because C<list()> in scalar context
gives an array ref. Allowing users to look at the buffer with C<size()> might
perhaps be useful in the context of streaming Jolt.
Redefining C<size()> this way wouldn't be a breaking change.

=item * Jolt: maybe check if for DELETE requests, accepting only Jolt yields an
octet-stream response that contains JSON; if so, perhaps add to #12644 report

=item * Jolt: implement streaming; however, this is unlikely to really yield
significant gains; except I<maybe> for queries with a super large number of
result rows, but even then, it's not certain if pure Perl can splice the Jolt
events efficiently enough for it to matter

=back

=head2 L<Neo4j::Driver::ResultSummary>

=over

=item * Add timers to L<Neo4j::Driver::ResultSummary> (see C<Neo4j::Bolt>).
Method names should be C<result_available_after> and C<result_consumed_after>,
both returning milliseconds with a default of C<-1> when unavailable (HTTP).

=item * Recent Neo4j versions have added C<database>.

=back

=head2 L<Neo4j::Driver::SummaryCounters>

=over

=item * It seems Neo4j 4 added new counters for system updates.
These are C<contains_system_updates> and C<system_updates>, the latter
returning the number of system updates. Neither is available in
L<Neo4j::Bolt> 0.4201 according to the docs; need to check source.

=back

=head2 L<Neo4j::Driver::Plugin>

=over

=item * As a micro-optimisation for the HTTP net adapter API, it could be
guaranteed for the C<http_header()> method that the returned hashref will not
be used by the driver/controller after the next call to C<request()>, so that
the underlying hash may be reused by the net adapter.

=back

=head2 L<Neo4j::Driver::Net::Bolt>

=over

=item * In the case of L<perlbolt#51|https://github.com/majensen/perlbolt/issues/51>,
it might be possible to try and reconnect (once) if the connection is in fact
closed by the lib. But that shouldn't happen any more now, so I'm not sure if
this idea is worth the effort.

=item * Once L<Neo4j::Types> removes the old default implementations, include
it in the version checks. Specifically, using Bolt with a new L<Neo4j::Types>
version will only work if the L<Neo4j::Bolt> version is also new (0.5000+).

=for comment
# in Net::Bolt::_verify_version() try block:
require Neo4j::Types;
Neo4j::Types->VERSION lt '2.50' and die sprintf "Neo4j::Bolt version 0.5000 required--this is only version %s\n", $bolt_version;

=back

=head2 L<Neo4j::Driver::Net::HTTP>

=over

=item * A small memory leak exists in C<new()>. Probably no big deal.
The config rework will eventually address this.

=item * Perl HTTP libraries like L<LWP> don't report OS L<errno|Errno> codes.
(BSD: C<man 2 intro>) C<$!> is unreliable. It might be possible to recreate
errno codes by parsing error string messages.
L<mentalisttraceur/errnoname|https://github.com/mentalisttraceur/errnoname>
might be of some use there. But this idea is very likely not worth the effort.

=item * There is a new-ish Aura Query API; it seems to offer a new query format
that also allows 3.2+ values as query params: C<application/vnd.neo4j.query>
L<https://neo4j.com/docs/query-api/current/>
Unfortunately it doesn't support transactions yet, so it's somewhat useless.
(Except maybe if C<vnd.neo4j.query> is allowed for regular HTTP API requests?)
Still, creating an experimental plugin for this would be a nice way to figure
out how the plugin API would have to look like in order to be useful.

=back

=head2 L<Neo4j::Driver::Net::HTTP::LWP>

=over

=item * As a micro-optimisation for Jolt event parsing, we should investigate
the best way to split the buffer; likely by using C<substr ... REPLACEMENT>
for the OOK hack, see L<http://nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/269043>

=back

=head2 Neo4j::Driver::Type::*

=over

=item * The C<eq> and C<ne> operators should perhaps be overloaded to allow
for element ID comparison on nodes and relationships.

=item * Consider whether to use C<use overload '%{}'> to allow direct
access to e. g. properties using the pre-0.13 hashref syntax. See
L<https://metacpan.org/pod/overload#Two-face-References> for an example.
L<perltie> might perhaps also work.
Note that L<overload> might be a memory hog; see L<Types::Serialiser/"BUGS">.

=item * Remove Type::Bytes and use the generic type instead
