=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is an unofficial Perl implementation of the
L<Neo4j Driver API|https://neo4j.com/docs/driver-manual/current/>.
It enables interacting with a Neo4j database server using the
same classes and method calls as the official Neo4j drivers do.

This driver extends the uniformity across languages, which is a
stated goal of the Neo4j Driver API, to Perl. The downside is that
this driver doesn't offer fully-fledged object bindings like the
existing L<REST::Neo4p> module does. Nor does it offer any L<DBI>
integration. However, it avoids the legacy C<cypher> endpoint,
assuring compatibility with Neo4j versions 2.3, 3.x and 4.x.

B<As of version 0.13, the interface of this software may be
considered stable.>

However, bugs may still exist. Also, experimental features may be
changed or deprecated at any time. If you find yourself reliant on
an experimental feature, please file a new issue requesting that it
be made stable.

There is an ongoing effort to clean up the experimental features.
For each of them, the goal is to eventually either declare it stable
or deprecate it. There is also ongoing work to further improve
general stability and reliability of this software. However, there
is no schedule for the completion of these efforts.

=head1 METHODS

L<Neo4j::Driver> implements the following methods.

=head2 basic_auth

 $driver->basic_auth('neo4j', 'password');

Set basic auth credentials with a given user and password. This
method returns the modified L<Neo4j::Driver> object, so that method
chaining is possible.

 $session = $driver->basic_auth('neo4j', 'password')->session;

=head2 config

 $driver->config( option1 => 'foo', option2 => 'bar' );

Sets the specified configuration option or options on a
L<Neo4j::Driver> object. The options are given in hash syntax.
This method returns the modified object, so that method chaining
is possible.

 $session = $driver->config(timeout => 60)->session;

See below for an explanation of
L<all supported configuration options|/"CONFIGURATION OPTIONS">.
Setting configuration options on a driver is only allowed before
creating the driver's first session.

Calling this method with just a single parameter will return the
current value of the config option named by the parameter.

 $timeout = $driver->config('timeout');

=head2 new

 $driver = Neo4j::Driver->new('http://localhost');

Construct a new L<Neo4j::Driver> object. This object holds the
details required to establish connections with a Neo4j database,
including server URIs, credentials and other configuration.

The URI passed to this method determines the type of driver created. 
Only the C<http> URI scheme is currently supported.

If a part of the URI or even the entire URI is missing, suitable
default values will be substituted. In particular, the host name
C<localhost> and the protocol C<http> will be used as defaults;
if no port is specified, the protocol's default port will be used.

 # all of these are semantically equal
 $driver = Neo4j::Driver->new;
 $driver = Neo4j::Driver->new('http:');
 $driver = Neo4j::Driver->new('localhost');
 $driver = Neo4j::Driver->new('http://localhost');
 $driver = Neo4j::Driver->new('http://localhost:7474');

=head2 session

 $session = $driver->session;

Creates and returns a new L<Session|Neo4j::Driver::Session>.

=head1 EXPERIMENTAL FEATURES

L<Neo4j::Driver> implements the following experimental features.
These are subject to unannounced modification or removal in future
versions. Expect your code to break if you depend upon these
features.

=head2 Bolt support

 # For this to work, Neo4j::Bolt must be installed:
 # https://github.com/majensen/perlbolt
 # https://github.com/majensen/perlbolt/blob/master/README
 
 $driver = Neo4j::Driver->new('bolt://localhost');

Installing the XS module L<Neo4j::Bolt>
(L<perlbolt|https://github.com/majensen/perlbolt>) adds support for
the L<Bolt Protocol|https://boltprotocol.org/>, which can be used as
an alternative to HTTP to connect to the Neo4j server. The design
goal for this driver is to offer equal support for Bolt and HTTP.
Where differences are unavoidable, they are documented.

Using Bolt is much faster than HTTP, but at time of this writing the
L<libneo4j-client|https://neo4j-client.net/#libneo4j-client> backend
library that Neo4j::Bolt uses to connect to the database server only
supports Neo4j version 3.x.

TLS encryption is disabled in early versions of L<Neo4j::Bolt>.
If you need remote access, consider using HTTPS instead of Bolt.

=head2 HTTPS support

 $driver = Neo4j::Driver->new('https://localhost');
 $driver->config(ca_file => 'neo4j/certificates/neo4j.cert');

Using HTTPS will result in an encrypted connection. In order to rule
out a man-in-the-middle attack, the server's certificate must be
verified. By default, this driver may be expected to use operating
system default root certificates (not really tested yet). This
will fail unless your Neo4j installation uses a key pair that is
trusted and verifiable through the global CA infrastructure. For
self-signed certificates (such as those automatically provided by
some Neo4j versions), you need to specify the location of a local
copy of the server certificate. The driver config option C<ca_file>
may be used for this; it corresponds to C<SSL_ca_file> in
L<LWP::UserAgent> and L<IO::Socket::SSL>.

See also the
L<Neo4j Operations Manual|https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/security/>
for details on Neo4j network security.

=head2 Parameter syntax conversion

 $driver->config(cypher_filter => 'params');

When this option is set, the driver automatically uses a regular
expression to convert the old Cypher parameter syntax C<{param}>
supported by Neo4j S<versions 2 and 3> to the new syntax C<$param>
supported by Neo4j S<versions 3 and 4>.

=head2 Type system customisation

 $driver->config(cypher_types => {
   node => 'Local::Node',
   relationship => 'Local::Relationship',
   path => 'Local::Path',
   point => 'Local::Point',
   temporal => 'Local::Temporal',
   init => sub { my $object = shift; ... },
 });

The package names used for C<bless>ing objects in query results can be
modified. This allows clients to add their own methods to such objects.

Clients must make sure their custom type packages are subtypes of the
base type packages that this module provides (S<e. g.> using C<@ISA>):

=over

=item * L<Neo4j::Driver::Type::Node>

=item * L<Neo4j::Driver::Type::Relationship>

=item * L<Neo4j::Driver::Type::Path>

=item * L<Neo4j::Driver::Type::Point>

=item * L<Neo4j::Driver::Type::Temporal>

=back

Clients may only use the documented API to access the data in the base
type. Direct data structure access might also work, but is unsupported
and discouraged because it makes your code prone to fail when any
internals change in the implementation of Neo4j::Driver. For those
objects that are implemented as blessed hash refs, clients may use any
hash keys that beginn with two underscores (C<__>) to store private
data. All other hash keys are reserved for use by Neo4j::Driver.

=head1 CONFIGURATION OPTIONS

L<Neo4j::Driver> implements the following configuration options.

=head2 timeout

 $driver->config(timeout => 60);  # seconds

Specifies the connection timeout. The semantics of this config
option vary by network library. Its default value is therefore
not defined here and is subject to change.

For details, see L<LWP::UserAgent/"timeout"> when using HTTP or
L<select(2)> when using Bolt.

The old C<< $driver->{http_timeout} >> syntax remains supported
for the time being in order to ensure backwards compatibility,
but its use is discouraged and it may be deprecated in future.

=head1 ENVIRONMENT

This software currently targets Neo4j versions 2.3, 3.x and 4.x.

This software requires at least Perl 5.10, though you should consider
using Perl 5.16 or newer if you can.

=head1 PERFORMANCE

Preliminary testing seems to indicate the two major bottlenecks are
the HTTP transport to and from the Neo4j server, and the JSON
parsing. Switching to the experimental Bolt protocol support may well
increase the speed tenfold. You are encouraged to run your own tests
for your specific application.

=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

Neo4j::Driver currently dies as soon as an error condition is
discovered. Use C<eval>, L<Try::Tiny> or similar to catch this.

Warnings are given when deprecated or ambiguous method calls are used.
These warnings may be disabled if desired.

 no warnings 'deprecated';
 no warnings 'ambiguous';

=head1 BUGS

See the F<TODO> document and Github for known issues and planned
improvements. Please report new issues and other feedback on Github.

Just like the official Neo4j drivers, this driver has been designed to strike
a balance between an idiomatic API for Perl and a uniform surface across all
languages. Differences between this driver and the official Neo4j drivers in
either the API or the behaviour are generally to be regarded as bugs unless
there is a compelling reason for a different approach in Perl.

Due to lack of resources, only the Neo4j community edition is targeted by this
driver at present.
