=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is an unofficial Perl implementation of the
L<Neo4j Driver API|https://neo4j.com/docs/driver-manual/current/>.
It enables interacting with a Neo4j database server using the
same classes and method calls as the official Neo4j drivers do.

This driver extends the uniformity across languages, which is a
stated goal of the Neo4j Driver API, to Perl. The downside is that
this driver doesn't offer fully-fledged object bindings like the
existing L<REST::Neo4p> module does. Nor does it offer any L<DBI>
integration. However, it avoids the legacy C<cypher> endpoint,
assuring compatibility with Neo4j versions 2.3, 3.x and 4.x.

Two different network protocols exist for connecting to Neo4j.
By default, Neo4j servers offer both, but this can be changed
in F<neo4j.conf> for each server; see
L<"Configure connectors" in the Neo4j Operations Manual|https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/configuration/connectors/>.

=over

=item Bolt

Bolt is a Neo4j proprietary, binary protocol, available with
S<Neo4j 3.0> and newer. Bolt communication may be encrypted or
unencrypted. Because Bolt is faster than HTTP, it is generally
the recommended protocol. However, Perl support for it may be
lagging after major updates to Neo4j.

This driver supports Bolt, but doesn't bundle the necessary XS
packages. You will need to install L<Neo4j::Bolt> separately
to enable Bolt.

=item HTTP / HTTPS

Support for HTTP is built into this driver, so it is always
available. HTTP is still fast enough for many use cases and
works even in a "Pure Perl" environment. It may also be
quicker than Bolt to add support for future changes in Neo4j.

HTTP connections will use B<Jolt> (JSON Bolt) when available.
For older Neo4j servers (before S<version 4.2>), the driver
will automatically fall back to REST-style JSON.

The driver also supports encrypted communication using HTTPS,
but doesn't bundle the necessary packages. You will need to
install L<LWP::Protocol::https> separately to enable HTTPS.

=back

The protocol is automatically chosen based on the URI scheme.
See L</"uri"> for details.

B<As of version 0.13, the interface of this software may be
considered stable.>

However, bugs may still exist. Also, experimental features may be
changed or deprecated at any time. If you find yourself reliant on
an experimental feature, please file a new issue requesting that it
be made stable.

There is an ongoing effort to clean up the experimental features.
For each of them, the goal is to eventually either declare it stable
or deprecate it. There is also ongoing work to further improve
general stability and reliability of this software. However, there
is no schedule for the completion of these efforts.

=head1 METHODS

L<Neo4j::Driver> implements the following methods.

=head2 basic_auth

 $driver->basic_auth('neo4j', 'password');

Set basic auth credentials with a given user and password. This
method returns the modified L<Neo4j::Driver> object, so that method
chaining is possible.

 $session = $driver->basic_auth('neo4j', 'password')->session;

=head2 config

 $driver->config({ option1 => 'foo', option2 => 'bar' });

Sets the specified configuration options on a L<Neo4j::Driver>
object. The options may be given as a hash or as a hash reference.
This method returns the modified object, so that method chaining
is possible.

 $session = $driver->config(timeout => 60)->session;

See L</"CONFIGURATION OPTIONS"> for a list of supported options.
Setting configuration options on a driver is only allowed before
creating the driver's first session.

Calling this method with just a single string parameter will return
the current value of the config option named by the parameter.

 $timeout = $driver->config('timeout');

=head2 new

 $driver = Neo4j::Driver->new({ uri => 'http://localhost' });

Construct a new L<Neo4j::Driver> object. This object holds the
details required to establish connections with a Neo4j database,
including server URIs, credentials and other configuration.

The C<new()> method accepts one or more configuration options given
as a hash reference. See L</"CONFIGURATION OPTIONS"> below for a
list of supported options. Alternatively, instead of the hash
reference, the Neo4j server URI may be given as a scalar string.

 $driver = Neo4j::Driver->new('http://localhost');

If C<new()> is called with no arguments, a default configuration
will be used for the driver.

=head2 session

 $session = $driver->session;

Creates and returns a new L<Session|Neo4j::Driver::Session>,
initiating a network connection with the Neo4j server.

Each session connects to a single database, which may be specified
using the C<database> option in a hash or hash reference passed
to this method. If no defined value is given for this
option, the driver will select the default database configured
in F<neo4j.conf>.

 $session = $driver->session( database => 'system' );

The C<database> option is silently ignored when used with Neo4j
S<versions 2> S<and 3>, which only support a single database.

=head1 EXPERIMENTAL FEATURES

L<Neo4j::Driver> implements the following experimental features.
These are subject to unannounced modification or removal in future
versions. Expect your code to break if you depend upon these
features.

=head2 Custom networking modules

 use Local::MyNetworkAgent;
 $driver->config(net_module => 'Local::MyNetworkAgent');

The module to be used for network communication may be specified
using the C<net_module> config option. The specified module must
implement the API described in L<Neo4j::Driver::Net/"EXTENSIONS">.
Your code must C<use> or C<require> the module it specifies here.

By default, the driver will try to auto-detect a suitable module.
This will currently always result in the driver's built-in modules
being used. Alternatively, you may specify the empty string to ask
for the built-in modules explicitly, which will disable
auto-detection.

 $driver->config(net_module => undef);  # auto-detect (the default)
 $driver->config(net_module => '');     # use the built-in modules

This config option is experimental because the API for custom
networking modules is still evolving. See L<Neo4j::Driver::Net>
for details.

=head2 Nested transactions in HTTP sessions

 $session = Neo4j::Driver->new({
   uri       => 'http://...',
   nested_tx => 1,
 })->session;
 $tx1 = $session->begin_transaction;
 $tx2 = $session->begin_transaction;
 $tx3 = $session->run(...);

The Neo4j Driver API officially doesn't allow multiple concurrent
transactions (or "nested transactions") to be open within the same
session. The standard way to work with multiple concurrent
transactions is to simply use multiple sessions. However, since
HTTP is a stateless protocol, nested transactions are still possible
on connections which use the C<http:> or C<https:> protocol scheme.

This driver allows nested transactions on HTTP when the
C<nested_tx> config option is enabled. Trying to enable this
option on a Bolt connection is a fatal error.

The default for HTTP connections is currently to enable nested
transactions, but this will likely change in a future version.
The driver will currently give warnings on a best-effort basis
when using nested transactions on HTTP I<without> enabling this
option, but these warnings may become fatal errors in future.

When using HTTP, you should consider making a conscious choice
regarding whether or not to use nested transactions, and configuring
your driver accordingly. This can help to avoid surprising behaviour
in case you switch to Bolt at a later point in time.

This config option is experimental because its name and semantics
are still evolving.

=head2 Parameter syntax conversion

 $driver->config( cypher_params => v2 );
 $bar = $driver->session->run('RETURN {foo}', foo => 'bar');

When this option is set, the driver automatically uses a regular
expression to convert the old Cypher parameter syntax C<{param}>
supported by Neo4j S<version 2> to the modern syntax C<$param>
supported by Neo4j S<version 3> and newer.

The only allowed value for this config option is the unquoted
literal L<v-string|perldata/"Version Strings"> C<v2>.

Cypher's modern C<$> parameter syntax unfortunately may cause string
interpolations in Perl, which decreases database performance because
Neo4j can re-use query plans less often. It is also a potential
security risk (Cypher injection attacks). Using this config option
enables your code to use the C<{}> parameter syntax instead. This
option is currently experimental because the API is still evolving.

=head1 CONFIGURATION OPTIONS

L<Neo4j::Driver> implements the following configuration options.

=head2 auth

 $driver->config(auth => {
   scheme      => 'basic',
   principal   => 'neo4j',   # user id
   credentials => $password,
 });

Specifies the authentication details for the Neo4j server.
The authentication details are provided as a Perl reference
that is made available to the networking module. Typically,
this is an unblessed hash reference with the authentication
scheme declared in the hash entry C<scheme>.

The Neo4j server uses the auth scheme C<'basic'> by default,
which must be configured with a user id in the hash entry
C<principal> and a password in the entry C<credentials>,
as shown above. Alternatively, the method L</"basic_auth">
can be used as a shortcut, or the basic auth details can be
specified as userinfo in the URI.

The C<auth> config option defaults to the value C<undef>,
which disables authentication.

=head2 encrypted

 $driver->config(encrypted => 1);

Specifies whether to use secure communication using TLS. This
L<implies|IO::Socket::SSL/"Essential Information About SSL/TLS">
not just encryption, but also verification of the server's identity.

By default, the local system's trust store will be used to verify
the server's identity. This will fail unless your Neo4j installation
uses a key pair that is trusted and verifiable through the global
CA infrastructure. If that's not the case, you may need to
additionally use the C<trust_ca> option.

This option defaults to C<0> (no encryption). This is generally what
you want if you connect to a server on C<localhost>.

This option is only useful for Bolt connections. For HTTP
connections, the use of TLS encryption is governed by the chosen
URI scheme (C<http> / C<https>).

Before version 0.27, this option was named C<tls>. Use of the
former name is now discouraged.

=head2 timeout

 $driver->config(timeout => 60);  # seconds

Specifies the connection timeout. The semantics of this config
option vary by network library. Its default value is therefore
not defined here and is subject to change.

For details, see L<LWP::UserAgent/"timeout"> when using HTTP or
L<select(2)> when using Bolt.

The old C<< $driver->{http_timeout} >> syntax remains supported
for the time being in order to ensure backwards compatibility,
but its use is discouraged and it may be deprecated in future.

=head2 trust_ca

 $driver->config(trust_ca => 'neo4j/certificates/neo4j.cert');

Specifies the path to a file containing one or more trusted TLS
certificates. When this option is given, encrypted connections will
only be accepted if the server's identity can be verified using the
certificates provided.

The certificates in the file must be PEM encoded. They are expected
to be "root" certificates, S<i. e.> the S<"CA bit"> needs to be set
and the certificate presented by the server must be signed by one of
the certificates in this file (or by an intermediary).

Self-signed certificates (such as those automatically provided by
some Neo4j versions) should also work if their S<"CA bit"> is set.

Before version 0.27, this option was named C<tls_ca>. Use of the
former name is now discouraged.

=head2 uri

 $driver->config(uri => 'http://localhost:7474');

Specifies the Neo4j server connection URI. The URI scheme determines
the type of driver created. Supported schemes are C<bolt>, C<http>,
and C<https>.
Use of C<bolt> URIs requires L<Neo4j::Bolt> to be installed; use
of C<https> URIs requires L<LWP::Protocol::https> to be installed.

If a part of the URI or even the entire URI is missing, suitable
default values will be substituted. In particular, the host name
C<localhost> and the protocol C<http> will be used as defaults;
if no port is specified, the protocol's default port will be used.

 # all of these are semantically equal
 $driver->config(uri =>  undef );
 $driver->config(uri => 'http:');
 $driver->config(uri => 'localhost');
 $driver->config(uri => 'http://localhost');
 $driver->config(uri => 'http://localhost:7474/');

=head1 ENVIRONMENT

This software currently targets Neo4j versions 2.3, 3.x and 4.x.

This software requires at least Perl 5.10, though you should consider
using Perl 5.16 or newer if you can.

=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

Neo4j::Driver currently dies as soon as an error condition is
discovered. Use C<eval>, L<Try::Tiny> or similar to catch this.

Warnings are given when deprecated or ambiguous method calls are used.
These warnings may be disabled if desired.

 no warnings 'deprecated';
 no warnings 'ambiguous';

=head1 BUGS

See the F<TODO> document and Github for known issues and planned
improvements. Please report new issues and other feedback on Github.

Just like the official Neo4j drivers, this driver has been designed to strike
a balance between an idiomatic API for Perl and a uniform surface across all
languages. Differences between this driver and the official Neo4j drivers in
either the API or the behaviour are generally to be regarded as bugs unless
there is a compelling reason for a different approach in Perl.

Due to lack of resources, only the Neo4j community edition is targeted by this
driver at present.

=head1 ACKNOWLEDGEMENT

Special thanks go to Mark A. Jensen (MAJENSEN). Without the
inspiration of his L<REST::Neo4p>, this driver project I<probably>
would never have been even gotten started. And without Mark's
tremendous work on L<Neo4j::Bolt> and libneo4j-client, this
driver I<certainly> would be a far cry from what it is today.
