Neo4j::Driver::TODO - Information on planned improvements to Neo4j::Driver

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The Neo4j::Driver TODO list is maintained in the git repository:

L<https://github.com/johannessen/neo4j-driver-perl/blob/master/TODO.pod>

A copy of the TODO list used to be installed in this location,
but this caused warnings during the release build phase. Also, a
snapshot that always tends to be slightly out of date may cause
confusion and installing it probably isn't very helpful anyway.
