# For example, for `RETURN 1 AS foo`, it would look like this:
#   $cache = { 'foo' => 0, '0' => 0 };

# Exceptionally, index/name collisions can occur (see record-ambiguous.t).
# The field names lookup cache is limited to cases where no ambiguity exists.
# A reference to the original list of field names is kept in
# the entry '' (empty string). Neo4j doesn't allow zero-length
# field names, so '' itself is never ambiguous.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 $record = $session->execute_write( sub ($transaction) {
   return $transaction->run( ... )->fetch;
 });
 
 $value = $record->get('name');  # field key
 $value = $record->get(0);       # field index
 
 # Shortcut for records with just a single key
 $value = $record->get;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Container for Cypher result values. Records are returned from Cypher
query execution, contained within a Result. A record is
a form of ordered map and, as such, contained values can be accessed
by either positional index or textual key.

To obtain a record, call L<Neo4j::Driver::Result/"fetch">.

=head1 METHODS

L<Neo4j::Driver::Record> implements the following methods.

=head2 get

 $value1 = $record->get('field_key');
 $value2 = $record->get(2);

Get a value from this record, either by field key or by zero-based
index.

When called without parameters, C<get()> will return the first
field. If there is more than a single field, a warning in the
category C<ambiguous> will be issued.

 $value = $session->run('RETURN "It works!"')->single->get;
 $value = $session->run('RETURN "warning", "ambiguous"')->single->get;

Values are returned from Neo4j as L<Neo4j::Types> objects and
as simple Perl references / scalars. For details and for known
issues with type mapping see L<Neo4j::Driver::Types>.

=head2 data

 $hashref = $record->data;
 $value = $hashref->{field_key};

Return the keys and values of this record as a hash reference.
