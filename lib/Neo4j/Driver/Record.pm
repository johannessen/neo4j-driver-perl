# The various JSON modules for Perl tend to represent a boolean false value
# using a blessed scalar overloaded to evaluate to false in Perl expressions.
# This almost always works perfectly fine. However, some tests might not expect
# a non-truthy value to be blessed, which can result in wrong interpretation of
# query results. The get_bool method was meant to ensure boolean results would
# evaluate correctly in such cases. Given that such cases are rare and that no
# specific examples for such cases are currently known, this method now seems
# superfluous.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Neo4j::Driver;
 my $session = Neo4j::Driver->new->basic_auth(...)->session;
 
 my $query = 'MATCH (m:Movie) RETURN m.name, m.year';
 my $records = $session->run($query)->list;
 foreach my $record ( @$records ) {
   say $record->get('m.name');
 }
 
 $query .= ' ORDER BY m.year LIMIT 1';
 my $record = $session->run($query)->single;
 say 'Age of oldest movie: ', $record->get(1);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Container for Cypher result values. Records are returned from Cypher
statement execution, contained within a StatementResult. A record is
a form of ordered map and, as such, contained values can be accessed
by either positional index or textual key.

=head1 METHODS

L<Neo4j::Driver::Record> implements the following methods.

=head2 get

 my $value1 = $record->get('field_key');
 my $value2 = $record->get(2);

Get a value from this record, either by field key or by zero-based
index.

Nodes, relationships and maps are returned as hash references of
their properties. Lists and paths are returned as array references.
Boolean values are returned as JSON types; use C<!!> to force-convert
to a plain Perl boolean value if necessary.

=head2 data

 my $hashref = $record->data;
 my $value = $hashref->{field_key};

Return the keys and values of this record as a hash reference.

=head1 EXPERIMENTAL FEATURES

L<Neo4j::Driver::Record> implements the following experimental
features. These are subject to unannounced modification or removal
in future versions. Expect your code to break if you depend upon
these features.

=head2 C<column_keys>

 my $size = $record->{column_keys}->count;
 $record->{column_keys}->add('new_field_key');

Allows adding new columns to the record's field key / index
resolution used by the C<get> method. Can be used to synthesize
'virtual' fields based on other data in the result. The new fields
can then be accessed just like regular columns.

=head2 C<graph>

 my $nodes = $record->{graph}->{nodes};
 my $rels  = $record->{graph}->{relationships};

Allows accessing the graph response the Neo4j server can deliver via
HTTP. Requires the C<return_graph> field to be set on the transaction
before the statement is executed.

=head2 C<meta>

 my $meta = $record->{meta};

Allows accessing the entity meta data that some versions of the Neo4j
server provide.
