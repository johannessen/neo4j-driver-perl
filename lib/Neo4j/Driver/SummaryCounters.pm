=head1 SYNOPSIS

  # $session = Neo4j::Driver->new({ ... })->session;
  
  $counters = $session->execute_write( sub ($transaction) {
    my $query = <<~'END';
      MATCH (m:Movie) WHERE m.released > 2000
      SET m.new = true
      END
    return $transaction->run($query)->consume->counters;
  });
  
  say sprintf '%i nodes updated.', $counters->properties_set;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Contains counters for various operations that a statement triggered.

To obtain summary counters, call
L<Neo4j::Driver::ResultSummary/"counters">.

Note that these statistics can be misleading in certain error
conditions. In particular, using them to verify whether database
modifications were successful is not advisable.
