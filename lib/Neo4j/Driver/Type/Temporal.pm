__END__

The Neo4j::Driver::Type::Temporal module was created to
mark temporal values returned from the Neo4j server.
However, beyond that, it was never implemented, and the
documentation has always carried the warning:

E<nbsp> The package name C<Neo4j::Driver::Type::Temporal> may change
in future.

Since the L<Neo4j::Types> model doesn't have a shared super-type
for temporal instants and temporal durations, this module is
no longer required.
