=head1 SYNOPSIS

 $q = "MATCH (a:Person)-[k:KNOWS]->(b:Person) RETURN k";
 $rel = $driver->session->run($q)->list->[0]->get('k');
 
 print 'Person id ', $rel->start_element_id;
 print ' ', $rel->type;
 print ' person id ', $rel->end_element_id;
 print ' since ', $rel->properties->{since};

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Describes a relationship from a Neo4j graph. A relationship may be a
part of L<records|Neo4j::Driver::Record> returned from Cypher
statement execution. Its description contains the relationship's
properties as well as certain meta data, all accessible by methods
that this class provides.

L<Neo4j::Driver::Type::Relationship> objects are not in a
one-to-one relation with relationships in a Neo4j graph. If the
same Neo4j relationship is fetched multiple times, then multiple
distinct L<Neo4j::Driver::Type::Relationship> objects will be
created by the driver. If your intention is to verify that two
L<Neo4j::Driver::Type::Relationship> objects in Perl describe the
same node in the Neo4j database, you need to compare their
element IDs.

=head1 METHODS

L<Neo4j::Driver::Type::Relationship> inherits all methods from
L<Neo4j::Types::Relationship>.

=head2 element_id

 $string = $relationship->element_id;

Return an ID for this relationship that is unique within
a particular context, for example the current transaction.

This method provides the new element ID string introduced by
S<Neo4j 5>. If the element ID is unavailable, for example with
older Neo4j versions or with a L<Neo4j::Bolt> version that
hasn't yet been updated for S<Neo4j 5>, this method provides
the legacy numeric ID instead. Note that a numeric ID cannot
successfully be used with C<elementId()> in Cypher expressions.

The behaviour of this method when the element ID is unavailable
is subject to change in a future version of the driver.
In particular, making this a fatal error is being considered.
This would help users to discover such issues early. See
L<Neo4j-Types PR#3|https://github.com/johannessen/neo4j-types/pull/3>
for further details.

Neo4j element IDs are not designed to be persistent. As such,
if you want a public identity to use for your relationships,
attaching an explicit 'id' property is a better choice.

=head2 get

 $value = $relationship->get('property_key');

See L<Neo4j::Types::Relationship/"get">.

=head2 id

 $number = $relationship->id;

Return a legacy numeric ID for this relationship that is unique
within a particular context, for example the current transaction.

Neo4j 5 has B<deprecated> numeric IDs. They will likely become
unavailable in future Neo4j versions. This method will try to
auto-generate a S<numeric ID> from the new S<element ID> value
(or return C<undef> if that fails). A deprecation warning is
issued by this method if the S<element ID> is available.

Neo4j relationship IDs are not designed to be persistent. As such,
if you want a public identity to use for your relationships,
attaching an explicit 'id' property is a better choice.

Legacy IDs are always integer numbers.
A relationship with the ID C<0> may exist.
Nodes and relationships do not share the same ID space.

=head2 properties

 $hashref = $relationship->properties;
 $value = $hashref->{property_key};

See L<Neo4j::Types::Relationship/"properties">.

=head2 start_element_id

 $string = $relationship->start_element_id;

Return an element ID for the node where this relationship starts.

This method provides the new element ID string introduced by
S<Neo4j 5>. If the element ID is unavailable, for example with
older Neo4j versions or with a L<Neo4j::Bolt> version that
hasn't yet been updated for S<Neo4j 5>, this method provides
the legacy numeric ID instead.

=head2 start_id

 $number = $relationship->start_id;

Return a numeric ID for the node where this relationship starts.

Neo4j 5 has B<deprecated> numeric IDs. They will likely become
unavailable in future Neo4j versions. This method will try to
auto-generate a S<numeric ID> from the new S<element ID> value
(or return C<undef> if that fails). A deprecation warning is
issued by this method if the S<element ID> is available.

=head2 end_element_id

 $string = $relationship->end_element_id;

Return an element ID for the node where this relationship ends.

This method provides the new element ID string introduced by
S<Neo4j 5>. If the element ID is unavailable, for example with
older Neo4j versions or with a L<Neo4j::Bolt> version that
hasn't yet been updated for S<Neo4j 5>, this method provides
the legacy numeric ID instead.

=head2 end_id

 $number = $relationship->end_id;

Return a numeric ID for the node where this relationship ends.

Neo4j 5 has B<deprecated> numeric IDs. They will likely become
unavailable in future Neo4j versions. This method will try to
auto-generate a S<numeric ID> from the new S<element ID> value
(or return C<undef> if that fails). A deprecation warning is
issued by this method if the S<element ID> is available.

=head2 type

 $type = $relationship->type;

See L<Neo4j::Types::Relationship/"type">.

=head1 BUGS

The value of properties named C<_meta>, C<_relationship>, C<_start>,
C<_end>, or C<_type> may not be returned correctly.

When using HTTP JSON, the C<type> of relationships that are returned as
part of a L<Neo4j::Driver::Type::Path> is unavailable, because that
information is not currently reported by the Neo4j server. C<undef>
is returned instead.
