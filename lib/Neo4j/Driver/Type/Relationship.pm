=head1 SYNOPSIS

 $q = "MATCH (a:Person)-[k:KNOWS]->(b:Person) RETURN k";
 $rel = $driver->session->run($q)->list->[0]->get('k');
 
 print 'Person # ', $rel->start_id;
 print ' ', $rel->type;
 print ' person # ', $rel->end_id;
 print ' since ', $rel->properties->{since};

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Describes a relationship from a Neo4j graph. A relationship may be a
part of L<records|Neo4j::Driver::Record> returned from Cypher
statement execution. Its description contains the relationship's
properties as well as certain meta data, all accessible by methods
that this class provides.

L<Neo4j::Driver::Type::Relationship> objects are not in a
one-to-one relation with relationships in a Neo4j graph. If the
same Neo4j relationship is fetched multiple times, then multiple
distinct L<Neo4j::Driver::Type::Relationship> objects will be
created by the driver. If your intention is to verify that two
L<Neo4j::Driver::Type::Relationship> objects in Perl describe the
same node in the Neo4j database, you need to compare their
IDs.

=head1 METHODS

L<Neo4j::Driver::Type::Relationship> inherits all methods from
L<Neo4j::Types::Relationship>.

=head2 get

 $value = $relationship->get('property_key');

See L<Neo4j::Types::Relationship/"get">.

=head2 id

 $id = $relationship->id;

See L<Neo4j::Types::Relationship/"id">.

=head2 properties

 $hashref = $relationship->properties;
 $value = $hashref->{property_key};

See L<Neo4j::Types::Relationship/"properties">.

=head2 start_id

 $id = $relationship->start_id;

See L<Neo4j::Types::Relationship/"start_id">.

=head2 end_id

 $id = $relationship->end_id;

See L<Neo4j::Types::Relationship/"end_id">.

=head2 type

 $type = $relationship->type;

See L<Neo4j::Types::Relationship/"type">.

=head1 EXPERIMENTAL FEATURES

L<Neo4j::Driver::Type::Relationship> implements the following
experimental features. These are subject to unannounced modification
or removal in future versions. Expect your code to break if you
depend upon these features.

=head2 Deletion indicator

 $node_exists = ! $relationship->deleted;

In some circumstances, Cypher statements using C<DELETE> may still
C<RETURN> relationships that were deleted. To help avoid confusion in
such cases, the server sometimes reports whether or not a relationship
was deleted.

This method is experimental because that information is not reliably
available. In particular, there is a known issue with the Neo4j server
(L<#12306|https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j/issues/12306>), and old Neo4j
versions may not report it at all. If unavailable, C<undef> will be
returned by this method.

=head1 BUGS

The value of properties named C<_meta>, C<_relationship>, C<_start>,
C<_end>, or C<_type> may not be returned correctly.

When using HTTP, the C<type> of relationships that are returned as
part of a L<Neo4j::Driver::Type::Path> is unavailable, because that
information is not currently reported by the Neo4j server. C<undef>
is returned instead.
