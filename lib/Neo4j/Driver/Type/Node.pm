=head1 SYNOPSIS

 $query = 'MATCH (m:Movie) RETURN m LIMIT 1';
 $node = $driver->session->run($query)->single->get('m');
 
 say 'Movie # ', $node->id(), ' :';
 say '   ', $node->get('name'), ' / ', $node->get('year');
 say '   Labels: ', join ', ', $node->labels;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Describes a node from a Neo4j graph. A node may be a
part of L<records|Neo4j::Driver::Record> returned from Cypher
statement execution. Its description contains the node's
properties as well as certain meta data, all accessible by methods
that this class provides.

L<Neo4j::Driver::Type::Node> objects are not in a
one-to-one relation with nodes in a Neo4j graph. If the
same Neo4j node is fetched multiple times, then multiple
distinct L<Neo4j::Driver::Type::Node> objects will be
created by the driver. If your intention is to verify that two
L<Neo4j::Driver::Type::Node> objects in Perl describe the
same node in the Neo4j database, you need to compare their
IDs.

=head1 METHODS

L<Neo4j::Driver::Type::Node> inherits all methods from
L<Neo4j::Types::Node>.

=head2 get

 $value = $node->get('property_key');

See L<Neo4j::Types::Node/"get">.

=head2 id

 $id = $node->id;

See L<Neo4j::Types::Node/"id">.

=head2 labels

 @labels = $node->labels;

See L<Neo4j::Types::Node/"labels">.

=head2 properties

 $hashref = $node->properties;
 $value = $hashref->{property_key};

See L<Neo4j::Types::Node/"properties">.

=head1 EXPERIMENTAL FEATURES

L<Neo4j::Driver::Type::Node> implements the following experimental
features. These are subject to unannounced modification or removal
in future versions. Expect your code to break if you depend upon
these features.

=head2 Calling in scalar context

 $labels = $node->labels;  # fails

The C<labels()> method C<die>s if called in scalar context.

=head2 Deletion indicator

 $node_exists = ! $node->deleted;

In some circumstances, Cypher statements using C<DELETE> may still
C<RETURN> nodes that were deleted. To help avoid confusion in
such cases, the server sometimes reports whether or not a node
was deleted.

This method is experimental because that information is not reliably
available. In particular, there is a known issue with the Neo4j server
(L<#12306|https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j/issues/12306>), and old Neo4j
versions may not report it at all. If unavailable, C<undef> will be
returned by this method.

=head1 BUGS

The value of properties named C<_meta>, C<_node>, or C<_labels> may
not be returned correctly.

When using HTTP, the C<labels> of nodes that are returned as
part of a L<Neo4j::Driver::Type::Path> are unavailable, because that
information is not currently reported by the Neo4j server. C<undef>
is returned instead.
