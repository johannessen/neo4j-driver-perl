=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Neo4j::Driver;
 $session = Neo4j::Driver->new->basic_auth(...)->session;
 
 # managed transaction function
 @records = $session->execute_read( sub ($transaction) {
   $transaction->run('MATCH (m:Movie) RETURN m')->list;
 });
 
 # unmanaged explicit transaction
 $transaction = $session->begin_transaction;
 
 # autocommit transaction
 $result = $session->run('MATCH (m:Movie) RETURN m.name, m.year');

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Provides a context of work for database interactions.

A Session is a logical container hosting a series of
L<transactions|Neo4j::Driver::Transaction> carried out against
a database. Transactions can be either managed, unmanaged, or
auto-commit transactions:

=over

=item Managed transaction functions

A transaction function bundles an atomic unit of work that is
either automatically committed when the function (subroutine)
returns, or rolled back if an exception is thrown during query
execution or by the user code. This means you don't have to
think much about steps like begin or commit â€“ the driver will
do it all for you.

However, transaction functions must always be idempotent,
because they might be retried (re-executed) multiple times
in certain error conditions, for example if the connection
breaks down during execution. See L</"execute_read"> and
L</"execute_write"> below.

=item Unmanaged explicit transactions

Instead of using transaction functions, you can choose to
handle begin, commit, rollback, and failures entirely yourself
in an I<unmanaged> transaction. This gives you more freedom
in your interactions with the transaction, but it's also
a bit more cumbersome. See L</"begin_transaction">.

=item Auto-commit transactions

For simple one-off queries where you don't want to deal with
explicit transactions at all, there is also a way to run
queries directly on a session. Opening a transaction before
and committing it afterwards happens implicitly on the server.
However, unlike a managed transaction function, auto-commit
queries will never be retried. See L</"run"> below.

=back

Only one open transaction per session at a time is supported. To
work with multiple concurrent transactions, simply use more than
one session.
On C<http:> and C<https:> connections, you can
alternatively enable concurrent transactions within the same
session through a config option (currently experimental);
see L<Neo4j::Driver/"Concurrent transactions in HTTP sessions">
for details.

To create a new session, call L<Neo4j::Driver/"session">.

=head1 METHODS

L<Neo4j::Driver::Session> implements the following methods.

=head2 begin_transaction

 $transaction = $session->begin_transaction;

Begin a new explicit L<Transaction|Neo4j::Driver::Transaction>.

=head2 execute_read

 @records = $session->execute_read( sub ($tx) {
   $tx->run('...')->list;
 });

Exactly like C<execute_write()>, except that it tries to route
the request to a read-only server if one is available. This is a
performance optimisation only and does not imply access control.

The effect of using this method to run queries that modify the
database is unspecified.

=head2 execute_write

 @records = $session->execute_write( sub ($tx) {
   $tx->run('...')->list;
 });

Execute a unit of work as a single, managed transaction with
retry behaviour. The transaction allows for one or more queries
to be run.

The driver will automatically commit the transaction when the
provided subroutine finishes execution. Any error raised during
execution will result in a rollback attempt. For certain kinds
of errors, the given subroutine will be retried with exponential
backoff until L<Neo4j::Driver/"max_transaction_retry_time">
(see L<Neo4j::Error/"is_retryable"> for the complete list).
Because of this, the given subroutine needs to be B<idempotent>
(S<i. e.>, have the same effect regardless of how many times
it is executed).

Note that L<Neo4j::Driver::Result> objects may not be valid
outside of the given subroutine. While the driver currently
doesn't prevent you from returning such an object from the
subroutine, the effect of doing so with results retrieved over
a Bolt connection is unspecified. A simple solution might be
to return the list of records from the subroutine instead,
which is always safe to do.

=head2 run

 $result = $session->run('...');

Run and commit a statement using an auto-commit transaction and return
the L<Result|Neo4j::Driver::Result>.

This method is semantically exactly equivalent to the following code,
but is faster because it doesn't require an extra server roundtrip to
commit the transaction.

 $transaction = $session->begin_transaction;
 $result = $transaction->run('...');
 $transaction->commit;

=head2 server

 $address = $session->server->address;
 $version = $session->server->agent;

Obtain the L<ServerInfo|Neo4j::Driver::ServerInfo>, consisting of
the host, port, protocol and Neo4j version.

=head1 EXPERIMENTAL FEATURES

L<Neo4j::Driver::Session> implements the following experimental
features. These are subject to unannounced modification or removal
in future versions. Expect your code to break if you depend upon
these features.

=head2 Concurrent transactions

 %config = ( uri => 'http://...', concurrent_tx => 1 );
 $session = Neo4j::Driver->new(\%config)->session;
 $tx1 = $session->begin_transaction;
 $tx2 = $session->begin_transaction;
 $tx3 = $session->run(...);

Since HTTP is a stateless protocol, the Neo4j HTTP API effectively
allows multiple concurrently open transactions without special
client-side considerations. This driver exposes this feature to the
client and will continue to do so, but the interface is not yet
finalised. See L<Neo4j::Driver/"Concurrent transactions in HTTP sessions">
for further details.

The Bolt protocol does not support concurrent transactions (sometimes
known as "nested transactions") within the same session.

=head1 SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS

Both L<Session|Neo4j::Driver::Session> as well as
L<Transaction|Neo4j::Driver::Transaction> objects internally hold
references to the authentication credentials used to contact the
Neo4j server. Objects of these classes should therefore not be
passed to untrusted modules. However, objects of the
L<ServerInfo|Neo4j::Driver::ServerInfo> class and the
L<Result|Neo4j::Driver::Result> class (if detached) do not
contain a reference to these credentials and are safe in this
regard.
